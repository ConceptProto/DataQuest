Introduction
#############

The reStructuredText (RST) syntax provides an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system. However, you need to be very precise and stick to some strict rules: 

    * like Python, RST syntax is sensitive to indentation !
    * RST requires blank lines between paragraphs

This entire document is written with the RST syntax. In the right sidebar, you should find a link **show source**, which shows the RST source code.
